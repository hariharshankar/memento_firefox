This option improves the chances to retrieve an archived page that is close to the selected time travel date. It is the recommended option.<br/><b>* Specific Archive:</b> When selecting this option, only page history available in the chosen archive is taken into account.<br/><b>* Unlisted Archive:</b> This option is provided for those familiar with the Memento protocol.

Be aware that the TimeGates available at that baseURI must be compliant with the <a href='http://www.mementoweb.org/guide/rfc/ID/'>Memento protocol</a>.
